GoodStuff Project - Work in progress (ideas)
==========

Charity or not for profit?
I want to help you.

My name is Chris Vasey and I am what you might call an "IT guy".
I work for a company called Italik where I support a range of diffrent customers of varied sizes and needs. I am part of the team that keeps there computers ticking away and working fine.

Although I have worked in IT support for the last 2 years one of my biggest passions has always been web design, I have designed and built countless apps and websites that will never see the light of day and a few that have or will soon, but the whole time I have just loved what I do.

I am looking for a new project where I can showcase how the use web technoligy can really help people.
If your chaity, project or not for profit matches the following things:
Is based in North Yorkshire (or close by)


 I can provide the tools to help them do this. The best part of all of this.. I want to do it for free.

What is the catch? I want to document the whole process and post it openly online for all to see. 

If you are interested or know anyone who might be, you can contact me here: chrismvasey@gmail.com


Why - Public sector companies have large budgets to spend on advertising/design - yet are only needed by a very small amount of people.
None profits have very small budgets yet need to be seen by large amounts of people.
There are so many tools that can help with this.


What is needed:
Presense and contact - Helping people find out how to contact you/find where you are
Awerness - Helping people find out infomation about your project or cause
Outreach - Using social media, mail shots and optimised search engine results to 
Blogs - Enable you to get the message out there online. What you are doing/how you can help
